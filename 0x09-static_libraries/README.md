Static Libraries
***

Static libraries are pretty self explanatory. This is a library that exists in a file and is used each time a function in it is called.It is usualy part of an executable-- kind of like the way a toroise carries its home on its back.This means that all library functions are used as copies resulting in a larger file, while the dynamic library doesn't carry all that baggage in its own executable files, thus is smaller. Like a leopard climbing into a tree. It is lightweight and leaves everyoone happier.

This project is for static libraries thoug, how to create one and check if it works.

- About the Project
***
This project creates a static library for a few functions that I have created along the way. Ideally, it is  something one can use to ger baseline functions such as atoi, isupper, etc.

-Required Software / Tools
***
The following tools were used:

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Editor: `vi`
* A good dose of `nm` and `ar`
* All files start with `#!/bin/bash`
