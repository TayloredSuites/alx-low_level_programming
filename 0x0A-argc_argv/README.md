- About the Project
***
What are the basic computer arguments, and what do they mean? The main function has a means of tracking what commands were issued and what number of commands were issued. This can be determined by getting the argument count and observing the nth command in the vector array. What this means simply is that for every computer argument, it has argc and argv, two potent trackers.
