# C Language Programming Fundamentals

***

- ## [Background to the Repository](https://github.com/TayloredSuites/alx-low_level_programming)

C is supposedly one of the shorter programming languages. It is contained in a handbook famously known as K & R. However, in order to utilize it properly, there is this here _megillah_ of things to know about C -- hence this project. This project is C based and aims to keep in line with the Betty linter. Files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`. 

As eponymously stated, it is an intoduction to low-level programming. It will grow to include pointers, data structures such as singly linked lists and bit manipulation. Each addition will be consecutively added as the projects go on.

- ## Relevant and Required Software

1. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
2. GCC with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. Valgrind
4. Vi, vim and emacs as editors 
5. Standard C libraries (e.g. standard input/output, headers, etc.)
6. Betty Linter

Coding style looks something like this:

```c

#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * Main - What is this?
 * @var: Tell me more
 *
 * Return: To MadMaxFuryRoad
 */
 void main(int var)
 {
    int result;
    
    var = 2;
    result = var * 8;
    
    return (result);
}

```

- ## Limitations

A lot of the projects did not go honky dory as one would expect. If you would like to see solutions that are less designed to fit the mould, you should feel free to contribute in whatever way you deem fit. I would love that, and would love to see other freestyle perspectives.

- ## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep in line with the code style and requirements. Also follow the format fot commit messages.

Thank you ☣️
