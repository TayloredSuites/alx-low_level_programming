C is supposedly one of the shorter programming languages. It is contained in a handbook famously known as K & R. However, in order to utilize it properly, there is this here _megillah_ of things to know about C -- hence this project. This project is C based and aims to keep in line with the Betty linter. Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. 

As eponymously stated, it is an intoduction to low-level programming. It will grow to include pointers, data structures such as singly lnked lists and bit manipulation. Each addition will be consecutively added as the projects go on.
